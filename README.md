# NOTES

- I am running into problems when trying to run or build using parcel: "Uncaught Error: The spineData param is required at (<i>multiple places</i>)". However it does run absolutely fine when using live-server.
- The default size of the app view given was huge, and looking back I imagine I was not expected to use the whole view (as it doesn't fit any normal viewport). I decided to use the full size of the app view in case this was the done thing and it needed to be that large. Apologies if this was wrong.
